The Active Player may choose any single result from the dice rolled, except you must always choose a blank if rolled (unless using a Superior Void-Engine).

Explosive - Perfect Encabulation: The affected Unit is removed from the Play Area and Placed at a new point anywhere in the Play Area. It gains a Level of Disorder and keeps the same facing.
Any Hit - Satisfactory Encabulation: The Unit is removed from the Play Area and Placed at a new point in the Play Area completely within 30” of its original position. It gains a Level of Disorder and keeps the same facing.
Any Counter - Delayed Encabulation: The Unit is removed from the Play Area and placed into Reserves..
Blank - Failed Encabulation: The affected Unit makes a Drift move, receives a Level of Disorder, and then ends its Activation if it has one.

Turbo Encabulation tests may not be re-rolled or otherwise manipulated except by a rule that specifically affects Turbo Encabulation tests. Models Placed must be in Open Water and in Coherency.

At the end of the Special Operations Step discard a Exosub SRS Token and roll an Action Die. On a Hit, Heavy Hit or Exploding Hit, the Minefield Marker is discarded. You may repeat this attempt as many times as there are Exosub SRS Tokens remaining in the stack. If the Minefield Marker is discarded, any remaining Exosub SRS Tokens in the stack may be placed on another Minefield Marker within 10”to continue a Mine Clearance attempt on that Marker. If there are not any Minefield Markers within 10”, the Exosub SRS Tokens remain in place until the End Phase when they may Scramble or Find New Targets.</description>
