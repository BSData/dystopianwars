    <rule id="db90-0b63-d0f9-5222" name="Portal Mastery" hidden="false">
      <description>This Unit may, as a Special Operations Action, place a 50mm Portal Token within 20” of itself. During the Round, any friendly Unit making an Attack with the Bomb Quality that has a Portal Marker within 5” of that Unit may measure the range of the Attack as though being made from any other Portal Marker. The Attacking Unit still requires Line of Sight to the Initial Target, but the weapon gains a 360 degree Fire Arc if used with a Portal. Furthermore, during the Reserves Step of that Round, when a friendly Unit becomes available from Reserve, it may be deployed within 2” of any Portal Marker rather than using any other deployment options. Each Model in the Reserve Unit must be deployed within 2” of the same Portal Marker. Remove Portal Markers once a Reserve Unit has been deployed within 2” of it, or an Attack using the Bomb Quality has been made from it or finally remove all remaining Portal Markers at the start of the Maintenance Step.</description>
